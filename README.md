This program simulate elevator in Base "Area 51". We have agents who use the elevator. When the elevator reaches the floor, the door opens only if the agent inside has the required
security credentials. If the agent doesnâ€™t have the required credentials, he can press another button in elevator to go to another level.
In Consequential version of the program everything is fine and work line by line wih methods.
In Threads version of the program every agent is serviced by a seperate thread. Also elevator is serviced by separate thread.
